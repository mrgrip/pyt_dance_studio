#Final Project

#PYT Dance Studio


#Instructions from Code Academy, 1st week
The design specs for this project are located here and the assets are located here. This will be your biggest challenge yet, so as always, make sure to work on it in reasonable pieces and commit your work each step of the way.

As you apply your skills in this large project, you might notice similar design features on different pages of the site. Take the time to map out your strategy for these sections ahead of time so you don't lose time copying and pasting code. If you do find yourself writing extremely similar pieces of code, don't be afraid to go back to your old code and refactor it. This will make your code easier to read, easier to use, and will save you time when debugging your code.

This will be a significant challenge that will push you to utilize everything you've learned in the past seven weeks. As always, frustration is normal and seeking help is part of the learning experience. Keep in mind that when you complete the project, you will have mastered all the skills you've learned over the course of this program, and you will be able to truly call yourself a website developer. Good luck!


#Instructions from Code Academy, 2nd week
Welcome to the second week of your final capstone project! Hopefully you feel proud of all of the work you accomplished last week.

Take some time to review how many of your planned milestones you were able to accomplish thus far. You can then use that knowledge to more accurately lay out your deadlines for this week.

You will soon learn how equally exciting and frustrating finishing up a large project like this can be. You will begin to see just how much you were able to accomplish in such a short time span! But you will also (most likely) have to iron out more bugs than you have had to in the past.

Debugging is an essential part of the development process that will continue throughout your professional career. Try not to cut corners and make sure that every aspect of your site matches the specs. This attention to detail will teach you invaluable skills in debugging large-scale products. Just know that once you make it through this part of the process, you'll be able to revel in the amazing work you've produced.

Good luck!
